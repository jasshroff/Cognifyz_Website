# Cognifyz_Website
This is my Frontend Website for my Internship at Cognifyz Technologies

Added initial website structure and assets

- Created `index.html` with a complete layout for the internship program, including sections for home, about, programs, benefits, application process, testimonials, and contact.
- Added CSS files: `bootstrap.min.css` for styling and `styles.css` for custom styles, including theme support and animations.
- Included JavaScript file `script.js` for interactivity, including theme toggling, scroll animations, and form validation.
- Added `Sources.txt` to document all external libraries and assets used in the project.
- Included logo images for branding in different themes.
- Integrated Leaflet.js for interactive maps in the contact section.
